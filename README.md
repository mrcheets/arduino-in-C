# Arduino projects in C (beginner level)
Curiousity has made this project. It is an answer to how do we reproduce the arduino kit projects with a barebone atmega328 microprocessor?

##Tools
- Avrdude 
- Microprocessor programmer
- Bread boards
- An atmega 328 microprocessor
- Various small components as needed

If you have the arduino tool kit you will need a crystal oscillator and some extra capacitors.
