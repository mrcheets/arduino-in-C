# Arduino projects in C (beginner level)
Curiousity has made this project. It is an answer to how do we reproduce the arduino kit projects with a barebone atmega328 microprocessor?

## Tools
- Avrdude 
- Microprocessor programmer
- Bread boards
- An atmega 328 microprocessor
- Various small components as needed
- Atmega328 datasheet

If you have the arduino tool kit you will need at least a crystal oscillator and some extra capacitors.
It is always a good idea to go through the datasheet to learn the various registers  and how they relate to the code
